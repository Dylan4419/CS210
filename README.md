#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project involved creating an interface within C++ and utilizing python to intake and read a file and have C++ display the chosen output.
The project had a text file with a list of different grocery items the depending on what was chosen by the chose would output different counts of the what was in the text file.
#What did you do particularly well?
The utilization of the two programs with text file. ensure both programs work together seemlessly.
#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
One area i would like to improve is with my inline comments. just because i was the first person to work on the project does not mean i will be the last.
#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I did not find anything extremely challenging, but i could see with added layers of code this may become more of a challenge.
#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The ability to seemlessly link two programs and utilize their strong areas to create the most well suited program.
#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Following industry standards closely and trying to make the most useful inline comments possible. This will allow for easy understanding if the code will ever need to be changed in the future.
